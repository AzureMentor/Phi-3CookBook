# **Fine-tuning Phi-3**

Fine-tuning Microsoft’s Phi-3 Mini language model using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) on a custom chat instruction dataset. 

LORA will help improve conversational understanding and response generation. 

## Step-by-step guide on how to fine-tune Phi-3 Mini:

**Imports and Setup** 

Begin by importing necessary libraries such as datasets, transformers, peft, trl, and torch.
Set up logging to track the training process.

**Hyperparameters** 
Define two dictionaries: training_config and peft_config. training_config includes hyperparameters for training, such as learning rate, batch size, and logging settings.

peft_config specifies LoRA-related parameters like rank, dropout, and task type.

**Model and Tokenizer Loading** 

Specify the path to the pre-trained Phi-3 model (e.g., "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct"). Configure model settings, including cache usage, data type (bfloat16 for mixed precision), and attention implementation.

**Training** 

Fine-tune the Phi-3 model using the custom chat instruction dataset. Utilize the LoRA settings from peft_config for efficient adaptation. Monitor training progress using the specified logging strategy.
Evaluation and Saving: Evaluate the fine-tuned model.
Save checkpoints during training for later use.

## Fine-Tuning Phi-3 with Azure AI Studio

### Set Up Your Environment 

**Azure AI Studio** 

If you haven’t already, sign in to Azure AI Studio.

**Create a New Project** 
Click on “New” and create a new project. Choose the appropriate settings based on your use case.

**Dataset Selection** 
Gather or create a dataset that aligns with your task. This could be chat instructions, question-answer pairs, or any relevant text data.

**Data Preprocessing** 
Clean and preprocess your data. Remove noise, handle missing values, and tokenize the text.

**Model Selection**
Phi-3 Mini: You’ll be fine-tuning the pre-trained Phi-3 Mini model. Make sure you have access to the model checkpoint (e.g., "microsoft/Phi-3-mini-128k-instruct").

**Fine-Tuning Configuration - Hyperparameters** 
Define hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of training epochs.
Loss Function: Choose an appropriate loss function for your task (e.g., cross-entropy).

**Optimizer** 
Select an optimizer (e.g., Adam) for gradient updates during training.

**Fine-Tuning Process - Load Pre-Trained Model** 
Load the Phi-3 Mini checkpoint.

**Add Custom Layers** 
Add task-specific layers (e.g., classification head for chat instructions).

**Train the Model** 
Fine-tune the model using your prepared dataset. Monitor training progress and adjust hyperparameters as needed.

**Evaluation and Validation - Validation Set** 
Split your data into training and validation sets.
Evaluate Performance: Use metrics like accuracy, F1-score, or perplexity to assess model performance.

**Save Fine-Tuned Model Checkpoint** 
Save the fine-tuned model checkpoint for future use.
Deployment: Deploy as a Web Service: Deploy your fine-tuned model as a web service in Azure AI Studio.
Test the Endpoint: Send test queries to the deployed endpoint to verify its functionality.
Iterate and Improve: Iterate: If the performance isn’t satisfactory, iterate by adjusting hyperparameters, adding more data, or fine-tuning for additional epochs.
Monitor and Refine: Continuously monitor the model’s behavior and refine as needed.

**Customize and Extend: Custom Tasks** 
Phi-3 Mini can be fine-tuned for various tasks beyond chat instructions. Explore other use cases!

**Experiment** 
Try different architectures, layer combinations, and techniques to enhance performance.

***Note***: Fine-tuning is an iterative process. Experiment, learn, and adapt your model to achieve the best results for your specific task. Fine-tuning allows you to adapt Phi-3 Mini to specific tasks, making it even more powerful and context-aware.
