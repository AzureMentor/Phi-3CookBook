# **Introduce Azure Machine Learning Service**

Azure Machine Learning is a cloud service for accelerating and managing the machine learning (ML) project lifecycle.

ML professionals, data scientists, and engineers can use it in their day-to-day workflows to:

- Train and deploy models.
Manage machine learning operations (MLOps).
- You can create a model in Azure Machine Learning or use a model built from an open-source platform, such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, or scikit-learn.
- MLOps tools help you monitor, retrain, and redeploy models.

## Who is Azure Machine Learning for?

**Data Scientists and ML Engineers**

They can use tools to accelerate and automate their day-to-day workflows.
Azure ML provides features for fairness, explainability, tracking, and auditability.
Application Developers:
They can integrate models into applications or services seamlessly.

**Platform Developers**

They have access to a robust set of tools backed by durable Azure Resource Manager APIs.
These tools allow building advanced ML tooling.

**Enterprises**

Working in the Microsoft Azure cloud, enterprises benefit from familiar security and role-based access control.
Set up projects to control access to protected data and specific operations.

## Productivity for Everyone on the Team
ML projects often require a team with a varied skill set to build and maintain.
Azure ML provides tools that enable you to:
Collaborate with your team via shared notebooks, compute resources, serverless compute, data, and environments.
Develop models with fairness, explainability, tracking, and auditability to fulfill lineage and audit compliance requirements.
Deploy ML models quickly and easily at scale, and manage and govern them efficiently with MLOps.
Run machine learning workloads anywhere with built-in governance, security, and compliance.

## Cross-Compatible Platform Tools

Anyone on an ML team can use their preferred tools to get the job done.
Whether youâ€™re running rapid experiments, hyperparameter tuning, building pipelines, or managing inferences, you can use familiar interfaces including:
- Azure Machine Learning Studio
- Python SDK (v2)
- Azure CLI (v2)
- Azure Resource Manager REST APIs

As you refine models and collaborate throughout the development cycle, you can share and find assets, resources, and metrics within the Azure Machine Learning studio UI
